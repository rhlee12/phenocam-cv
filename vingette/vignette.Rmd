Lets look at snowcover for YELL, in October. The understory phenocam images for that month looks interesting, with snowfall and periods of snow coming and going thruout the month:

```{r yellOverview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="_A screenshot of the YELL understory phenocam images for October 2019_", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("YELL-Oct.png")
```



```{r imageGet}
site = "YELL"

# To speed up vignette production we collate the information and save it as octoberSnow.RDS. 

# If that .RDS doesn't exist, the code below re-creates it.
if(!file.exists("octoberSnow.RDS")){
# Make a sequence of dates that we're interested in, in Oct
# Is this needlessly complicated? Yes. 
october=1:lubridate::days_in_month(10) %>%

# Loop thru our URLs, performing a snow detect on each of them. Unlist the result

# we had to drop some urls for not bing noon images. what did we get?
